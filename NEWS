Changes in version 0.1.2-1

o added male and female correlation data from the AIST 3 by Bergman & Eder (2019)

o Note: After further testing it appears that the functions Circ_emp(), Circ_pro(), Circ_test() and the 'internal' functions attached to them can lead to error messages when using Mplus versions <= 7.4 (thanks to Chet Robie for this finding). It is recommended to use Mplus versions >= 8.4.

o added function sim_score_data()

o added function plot_profile_holand()

o fixed some character encoding mismatch with UTF-8 in 'Mplus_psyn.R'

Changes in version 0.1.0-6
